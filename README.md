# LoRa32u4II_DorjiDRF1276DM_Wireless_Communication
One of the most delicate problems to solve, and which you could encounter, is that of ensuring wireless communication between Dorji DRF1276DM module and LoRa32u4II board (LoRa technology). Many people face this problem and start lokking for the solution on the internet, but the lack of documentation and resources on the internet and the modernity of LoRa technology in the market, are the main reasons which make them unable to solve this problem and find the correct answers to their questions. I was personally one of these people and I struggled for a month to solve this problem which was part my Master's end-of-study project (from 1 February 2019 to 13 June 2019). After several failed attempts to transfer the data packets through the network, I finally managed to find the solution and fully understand how I can establish wireless communication between the two boards. Today I am sharing this solution with you on GitHub to let you overcome this problem, towards the goal of exploiting this wireless communication in your own applications. I remain at your entire disposal, do not hesitate to contact me at h.taous@ump.ac.ma if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions, or if you need assistance.
